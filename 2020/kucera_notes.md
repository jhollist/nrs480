1. Job: 
  - Federal Bio Technician with NOAA
  - No relocation - is this a big deal?
  - Specialized experience
2. Cover Letter
  - "brat":  Could go either way on this term.  I realize it common/colloquial, but some search committees might see it as too informal.  Key with a cover letter is to not give them a reason to put you in the "No" pile.  
  - "observing your listing":  Use more straightforward language.  
  - "culminate": Straightforward language
  - "your team": For fed jobs, the person listed is usually an HR person, on not who you would work for.  Use language here that is a bit more general (e.g. "join NOAA", "work for NOAA" etc.)
3. Resume
  - Format:  For federal jobs, it is a VERY good idea to use the USAJobs resume format.  Your format looks great, but with Fed jobs, the first cut is made by an HR person who doesn't really know anything about the position.  They will be looking for keywords from the announcement in your resume/CV and they know the USA Jobs formats.
  - Terms:  Make sure you re-use the terms (e.g. at-sea, field operations) in the job announcment in the Resume.  
  - While you absolutely should have a standard resume/CV, it is always a good idea to target it towards the specific job.  This is especially true for fed positions given that they are first culled for meeting basic criteria and those need to be backed in the resume.
