1. Job: 
  - MS/PhD grad student at UNH - small mammal dynamics
2. Cover Letter:
  - "I look forward to explaining this skill set..."
    - felt a little awkward.  I think you could drop this sentence.
3. Resume:
  - While you absolutely should have a resume/CV ready to hand out, it is always a good idea to target it towards the specific job. Did you do that with this position?  If not, dig through Dr. Rowe's lab site and see if there are skills/experience of yours you can highlight that might match Dr. Rowe's interests/needs for the position.
4. General thoughts:
  - You're undergraduate background is very well suited to grad school.  This looks like a good fit for your skills and experience.  Overall a very strong application.  Great job.
