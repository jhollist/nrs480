1. Job: 
  - Insect Pollinator Technician in Aubrun Bee Lab
2. Cover letter:
  - No comments...  Nice job.
3. Resume
  - Some more details on "analytical skills"
  - While you absolutely should have a standard resume/CV ready, it is always a good idea to target it towards the specific job. Did you do that with this position?  Take some of the wording in the announcement and re-use in your CV if relevant.
4. General thoughts:  
  - Looks like a pretty strong application package to me.  Nothing jumped out as being off.
