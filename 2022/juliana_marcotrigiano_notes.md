1. Job: 
  - Brown Tree snake Research Associate
2. Cover Letter:
  - Good job.
3. Resume:
  - The spadefood toad work should be listed more a research experience.  Perhaps as another listing in the wildlife and environmental science experience section?  
  - List R Studio as R/RStudio.  The thing you want to highlight here is R experience.  RStudio is just one way of many to interact with R.
4. General thoughts:
  - Nice job.  You cover letter was particularly good as you provided details on your experience that should be a interest to those reviewing the applications.
