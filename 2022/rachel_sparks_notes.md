1. Job: 
  - Mountain lion research and ecology intern
2. Cover Letter:
  - Remove the "Mountian Lion Research and Ecology Intern" form the header.  Looks like that is your current gig!
  - Add address/contact details for Jeff Sikich.  At least the email.
  - "greenbrier" should be "greenbriar"?
3. Resume:
  - Instead of RStudio, just list R or list it as R/RStudio.  RStudio is one way to work with R and it is using R that employers will find useful.
4. General thoughts:
  - Good job overall!  One of the inrernship requirements was "Must have previous field experience working on a wildlife project".  You did a really nice job in the second paragraph of your cover letter of highlighting how you met that requirement with the camera traps and the greenbriar/bird next study.
