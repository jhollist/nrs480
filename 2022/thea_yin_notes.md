1. Job: 
  - Biological Technician at SERC
2. Cover Letter:
  - Define APAIS
  - "laboring" should be "laboratory"?
  - Provide more detail on the type of lab and field experience you got with Watershed Watch and as a GIS Assistant
3. Resume:
  - Flip order of Awards, most recent first.
4. General thoughts:
  - You letter and resume both look good.  As I mentioned above, I would try to add more details to the letter about your field and lab experience.  The job announcement is clear that they want this experience and the more details you provide in the letter, the better the chance your application will make it past the first round reviews.
